## The War Within Pre-Patch
The sections have all been updated for TWW Pre-Patch but take this information lightly. It is normal for several bugs or things to pop up that might change some of this data. We will do our best to keep this updated but our focus is primarily on the expansion launch and builds for Season 1.
- For a list of all the changes for Shadow Priest check out the [IcyVeins Guide](<https://www.icy-veins.com/wow/shadow-priest-the-war-within-pve-guide>)
- *Note:* Hero Talents start at level 71 and as such are _not_ available during Pre-Patch.

### Known Issues
All bugs can be found [here](<https://github.com/SimCMinMax/WoW-BugTracker/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3APriest+>). Below are the most impactful ones.
- [Idol of C'Thun is completely broken](<https://github.com/SimCMinMax/WoW-BugTracker/issues/1218>) - Hopefully this is fixed soon but until then there is no point in talenting this.
- [Halo is pulling mobs that are not currently in combat](<https://github.com/SimCMinMax/WoW-BugTracker/issues/1217>)
- [Mind Vision](<https://github.com/SimCMinMax/WoW-BugTracker/issues/1198>) and [Mind Soothe](<https://github.com/SimCMinMax/WoW-BugTracker/issues/1197>) are not castable
