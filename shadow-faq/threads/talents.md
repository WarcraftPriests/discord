*Note: :ms: [Mind Spike](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=73510>) builds are roughly equal to
:mf: [Mind Flay](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=15407>) builds, play whichever you prefer.*
## Single Target + :sc: [Shadow Crash](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=205385>)
---------------------------ST + CRASH IMAGE HERE---------------------------
These builds maximize single target damage while still having :sc: [Shadow Crash](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=205385>) and :sc: [Whispering Shadows](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=406777>).

Taking these builds you lose about **1.5%** single target damage on average.

If you are confident with :voit: [Void Torrent](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=263165>) usage you can swap out of :yshaarj: [Idol of Y'Shaarj](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=373310>) for Malediction
and use :dark_evang: [Dark Evangelism](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=391095>) over :mind_dev: [Mind Devourer](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=373202>).

*Note: The :ms: [Mind Spike](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=73510>) build is roughly **0.5%** ahead of the :mf: [Mind Flay](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=15407>) build on pure single target.
# 3 Target Council of Dreams
---------------------------3T IMAGE HERE---------------------------
This build is designed specifically for Council of Dreams where you have 2 targets stacked and 1 off spread from the other two for a unique council boss. If you are able to keep the bosses stacked
more you might see more value from the Void Eruption build.

# Dungeons
The below section is a high level overview of the top builds for dungeons. For more detail and other builds check out the :icyveins1: [IcyVeins](<https://www.icy-veins.com/wow/shadow-priest-pve-dps-mythic-plus-tips>) guide.

In addition to the builds below you can also consider running the Single Target + :sc: [Shadow Crash](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=205385>) build from the raid section above if you are trying to maximize Single Target damage.

These builds use flex points. The following can be swapped around and are within 1% damage of each other. These are roughly listed in order of strength.
- :mind_dev: [Mind Devourer](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=373202>) (Good with :dr: [Distorted Reality](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=409044>) builds)
- - :vt: [Maddening Touch](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=391228>) (Good with :dp: [Mind's Eye](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=407470>) builds)
- :dark_evang: [Dark Evangelism](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=391095>) (Overall)
- :mental_decay: [Mental Decay](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=375994>) (Single Target)
- :phantasmal: [Phantasmal Pathogen](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=407469>) (Single Target/Yogg Builds)
- :voidtouched: [Voidtouched](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=407430>) (Burst/:mf: [Mind Flay](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=15407>))

:dr: [Distorted Reality](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=409044>) and :dp: [Mind's Eye](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=407470>) are basically identical in terms of damage output in Mythic+. Certain builds will prefer Mind's Eye for more priority target damage inside AoE, while others will like Distorted Reality to make managing Devouring Plague easier. Pick whichever you prefer.

:ms: [Mind Spike](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=73510>) and :mf: [Mind Flay](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=15407>) builds are generally within 1% of each other depending on variants. They are close enough to where you can play whichever you personally prefer.

While most situations you will see better results with :da: [Dark Ascension](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=391109>), as you get into higher push keys :void_eruption: [Void Eruption](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=228260>) still becomes competitive if not better as you are doing bigger pulls, less of them especially on Fortified weeks.

You can also choose to play with either :mastermind: [Mastermind](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=391151>) or :screams: [Screams of the Void](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=375767>) to path into :nzoth1: [Idol of N'Zoth](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=373280>) for most builds. Mastermind gives you an edge in single target while Screams of the Void gives you an edge in AoE.
---------------------------BREAKDOWN IMAGE HERE---------------------------
## :nzoth1: [N'Zoth](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=373280>) + :cthun: [C'Thun](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=377349>) Build
General build that is the foundation m+ build.

I've listed several variations of this build, all of which are competitive. The :icyveins1: [IcyVeins](<https://www.icy-veins.com/wow/shadow-priest-pve-dps-mythic-plus-tips>) guide goes over these choices in depth.

With both of these builds you can also choose to drop Mindbender and :ist: [Inescapable Torment](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=373427>) to get both :mastermind: [Mastermind](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=391151>) and :screams: [Screams of the Void](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=375767>). This is particularly valuable in more trash focused environments like Black Rook Hold, Everbloom, Throne of the Tides, and Waycrest Manor during Fortified weeks. This gives you a boost in damage above 4 targets for a small loss below that.

### :da: [Dark Ascension](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=391109>) Version

- If you would like to use :dp: [Mind's Eye](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=407470>) the build is exactly the same with either choice.
- If you would like to use :mf: [Mind Flay](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=15407>) drop :ms: [Mind Spike](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=73510>) and Mind Melt for :voidtouched: [Voidtouched](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=407430>) and the last point in :dark_evang: [Dark Evangelism](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=391095>).

- For the :dp: [Mind's Eye](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=407470>) variant swap out :mind_dev: [Mind Devourer](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=373202>) for :vt: [Maddening Touch](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=391228>).
- If you would like to use :ms: [Mind Spike](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=73510>), drop :voidtouched: [Voidtouched](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=407430>) and one point of Mind Devourer for Mind Spike and Mind Melt.
- This build can drop :am: [Ancient Madness](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=341240>) for 1 point in :phantasmal: [Phantasmal Pathogen](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=407469>) or :vt: [Maddening Touch](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=391228>).

## :apps: [Shadowy Apparitions](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=341491>) Build
---------------------------SA BUILD IMAGE HERE---------------------------
This build specializes in maximizing damage with :apps: [Shadowy Apparitions](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=341491>) for more raw AoE damage by sacrificing Single Target damage.

When using full Season 3 gear and the new set bonus, this build is on average a 4% damage loss when pulling normally. If you are going to use this build you need to be pulling the dungeon around your cooldowns, and pulling large groups of mobs together. This is to offset the loss in single target, roughly 7%. Looking at specifically AoE environments, you can start to see increases at 4+ targets over other builds, anywhere from 3-13% increases depending on the
builds and target counts.

**This build is only suggested for people that are confident with the Void Eruption playstyle in coordinated groups. Most players will see better results on average with the other builds.**

[VF_nzoth_yogg_59604915951535_Flay_DR](<https://www.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/shadow/DAREEAVFEERUFEKFSKBQCBQNVRFUQVRKVRKAUBU>)
```

```

If you would like to use :dp: [Mind's Eye](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=407470>) I would strongly suggest also using :ms: [Mind Spike](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=73510>) as it is considerably further ahead of :mf: [Mind Flay](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=15407>) with that build.
