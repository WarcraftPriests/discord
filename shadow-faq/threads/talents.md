**Pre-Patch is going to be a bit unstable so take these builds with a grain of salt. We are focused on TWW resources and guides as our first priority.**

## Single Target + :sc: [Shadow Crash](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=205385>)
These builds maximize single target damage while still having :sc: [Shadow Crash](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=205385>) and :sc: [Whispering Shadows](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=406777>).

Taking these builds you lose about **3%** single target damage on average.

# Council Multi-Target
This build is designed to work with multi-target sustained Council-type bosses in raids. It is a version of what we also run in Mythic+, with slight variations for sustained damage patterns.

# Dungeons
The below section is a high level overview of the top builds for dungeons. For more detail and other builds check out the :icyveins1: [IcyVeins](<https://www.icy-veins.com/wow/shadow-priest-pve-dps-mythic-plus-tips>) guide.

In addition to the builds below you can also consider running the Single Target + :sc: [Shadow Crash](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=205385>) build from the raid section above if you are trying to maximize Single Target damage.

These builds use flex points. The following can be swapped around and are within 1% damage of each other. These are roughly listed in order of strength.
- :mind_dev: [Mind Devourer](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=373202>) (Overall)
- :vt: [Maddening Touch](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=391228>) (AoE, particularly good with :dp: [Mind's Eye](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=407470>) builds)
- :dark_evang: [Dark Evangelism](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=391095>) (AoE)
- :mental_decay: [Mental Decay](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=375994>) (Single Target)
- :phantasmal: [Phantasmal Pathogen](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=407469>) (Single Target with Mind's Eye and also AoE with Distorted Reality)
- :voidtouched: [Voidtouched](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=407430>) (Burst/:mf: [Mind Flay](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=15407>))

:dp: [Mind's Eye](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=407470>) will give you more single-target priority target damage while in AoE, and :dr: [Distorted Reality](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=409044>) will be stronger overall, or in multi-target priority setups. Feel free to choose whichever you prefer.

By default the builds below assume you need Mental Fortitude (defensive) and Silence (utility). If you do not need both of these you can drop one for more throughput by adding back a flex point (usually Mental Decay or Mind Devourer).

## :nzoth1: [N'Zoth](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=373280>) + :cthun: [C'Thun](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=377349>) Build
This build is particularly strong in lower key environments where you might just be pulling one pack at a time. If you are just starting out with the spec, or do not have the Season 4 set bonus I would suggest starting with this build.

[N'Zoth + C'Thun - Mind's Eye](<https://www.wowhead.com/beta/talent-calc/priest/shadow/DAREFAVFEERUFEKFRKBQCBUNVVFUVVECUVggRCUQAA>)
