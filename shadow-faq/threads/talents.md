**NOTE:** The following builds are made with the Season 4 set bonus in mind. If you are still using the Season 3 set bonus you should use [these builds](<https://gist.github.com/seanpeters86/103b5aac6c707593c2a6dd25d740bd21>) until you get the new 4-set. If you do not have any tier yet you should use the new builds below.

# Single Target

```

```

These builds are very close together, with Void Eruption doing slightly better with general movement encounters and Dark Ascension doing slightly better when you are able to turret. Pick the one you prefer and enjoy Season 4!
## Single Target + :sc: [Shadow Crash](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=205385>)
---------------------------ST + CRASH IMAGE HERE---------------------------
These builds maximize single target damage while still having :sc: [Shadow Crash](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=205385>) and :sc: [Whispering Shadows](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=406777>).

Taking these builds you lose about **3%** single target damage on average.

[Dark Ascension](<https://www.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/shadow/DAREEAVFEERUFEKFSKBQCBQNVFFUVVEKRUgkBBR>)
```

```

```

Dark Ascension will generally outperform Void Eruption anytime you _need_ to pickup Shadow Crash. These are still close enough you can run Void Eruption if you really want though.

# Council Multi-Target
---------------------------Council IMAGE HERE---------------------------
This build is designed to work with multi-target sustained Council-type bosses in raids. It is a version of what we also run in Mythic+, with slight variations for sustained damage patterns.

# Dungeons
The below section is a high level overview of the top builds for dungeons. For more detail and other builds check out the :icyveins1: [IcyVeins](<https://www.icy-veins.com/wow/shadow-priest-pve-dps-mythic-plus-tips>) guide.

In addition to the builds below you can also consider running the Single Target + :sc: [Shadow Crash](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=205385>) build from the raid section above if you are trying to maximize Single Target damage.

These builds use flex points. The following can be swapped around and are within 1% damage of each other. These are roughly listed in order of strength.
- :mind_dev: [Mind Devourer](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=373202>) (Overall)
- :vt: [Maddening Touch](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=391228>) (AoE, particularly good with :dp: [Mind's Eye](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=407470>) builds)
- :dark_evang: [Dark Evangelism](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=391095>) (AoE)
- :mental_decay: [Mental Decay](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=375994>) (Single Target)
- :phantasmal: [Phantasmal Pathogen](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=407469>) (Single Target with Mind's Eye and also AoE with Distorted Reality)
- :voidtouched: [Voidtouched](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=407430>) (Burst/:mf: [Mind Flay](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=15407>))

:dp: [Mind's Eye](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=407470>) will give you more single-target priority target damage while in AoE, and :dr: [Distorted Reality](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=409044>) will be stronger overall, or in multi-target priority setups. Feel free to choose whichever you prefer.

By default the builds below assume you need Mental Fortitude (defensive) and Silence (utility). If you do not need both of these you can drop one for more throughput by adding back a flex point (usually Mental Decay or Mind Devourer).

## Triple Idol Build
---------------------------Triple Idol BUILD IMAGE HERE---------------------------
This build will be your goto build for Season 4. It particularly does well once you get your new tier set bonus for the season. I would start off running Mind's Eye for the increased priority target damage and simpler playstyle, but if you want more overall damage by spreading Devouring Plague try to the Distorted Reality version.

## :nzoth1: [N'Zoth](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=373280>) + :cthun: [C'Thun](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=377349>) Build
---------------------------DA YSHAARJ DUNGEON IMAGE HERE---------------------------
This build is particularly strong in lower key environments where you might just be pulling one pack at a time. If you are just starting out with the spec, or do not have the Season 4 set bonus I would suggest starting with this build.

[N'Zoth + C'Thun - Distorted Reality](<https://www.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/shadow/DAREFAVFEERUFEKFRKBQCBUNVVFUVVECUVggRBR>)
