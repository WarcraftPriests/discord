*Note: :ms: [Mind Spike](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=73510>) has a slightly higher theoretical max (+0.7%) if you are able to fully turret.*
## Single Target + :sc: [Shadow Crash](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=205385>)
These builds maximize single target damage while still having :sc: [Shadow Crash](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=205385>) and :sc: [Whispering Shadows](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=406777>).

# 3 Target Council of Dreams
This sim is designed specifically for Council of Dreams where you have 2 targets stacked and 1 off spread from the other two for a unique council boss. This is still being tweaked but there are two competitive builds depending on if you want more priority target damage or more overall/cleave with :nzoth1: [Idol of N'Zoth](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=373280>).

# Dungeons
These builds still use flex points. The following can be swapped around and are within 1% damage of each other. These are roughly listed in order of strength.
- :mental_decay: [Mental Decay](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=375994>) (Single Target)
- :dark_evang: [Dark Evangelism](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=391095>)
- :mind_dev: [Mind Devourer](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=373202>) (Good with :dr: [Distorted Reality](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=409044>) builds)
- :phantasmal: [Phantasmal Pathogen](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=407469>)
- :vt: [Maddening Touch](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=391228>) (Good with :dp: [Mind's Eye](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=407470>) builds)
- :voidtouched: [Voidtouched](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=407430>) (Burst/:mf: [Mind Flay](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=15407>))

:dr: [Distorted Reality](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=409044>) is generally still outperforming :dp: [Mind's Eye](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=407470>) in the overall, although certain builds will prefer Mind's Eye for more single target or priority target damage. Pick whichever you prefer.
- 1.38% more m+ overall avg with Distorted Reality
- 0.29% more st with Distorted Reality

:ms: [Mind Spike](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=73510>) and :mf: [Mind Flay](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=15407>) builds are generally within margin of error. Higher push keys slightly prefer Mind Flay generally speaking. They are close enough to where you can play whichever you personally prefer.

While most situations you will see better results with :da: [Dark Ascension](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=391109>), as you get into higher push keys :void_eruption: [Void Eruption](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=228260>) still becomes competitive if not better as you are doing bigger pulls, less of them.

In the below table I also show options for using :mastermind: [Mastermind](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=391151>) (MM) vs. :screams: [Screams of the Void](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=375767>) (Screams). You will typically see Mastermind do better in Single Target situations but Screams will perform well the more raw AoE you have in the key.

## :yshaarj: [Y'Shaarj](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=373310>) + :nzoth1: [N'Zoth](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=373280>) + :cthun: [C'Thun](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=377349>)
General build that is the foundation m+ build.

I've listed several variations of this build, all of which are competitive. Use the rough list to help understand which one makes sense for your key:
- :da: [Dark Ascension](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=391109>): Standard option that will perform well in most keys of any level.
- :void_eruption: [Void Eruption](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=228260>): Heavily trash focused build that thrives the more mobs you pull at once for a noticeable dip in single target. Particularly intended for high push keys.

Note: you can still play :ms: [Mind Spike](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=73510>) versions with :da: [Dark Ascension](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=391109>) builds if you prefer.

## :yshaarj: [Y'Shaarj](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=373310>) + :cthun: [C'Thun](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=377349>)
This build drops :nzoth1: [Idol of N'Zoth](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=373280>) and is a slight variation to the Raid Single Target build to add :sc: [Shadow Crash](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=205385>). This is equally competitive in Mythic+ dungeons, especially for Tyrannical weeks. As always you can still take :dp: [Mind's Eye](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=407470>) with these builds if you prefer.
