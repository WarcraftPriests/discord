These builds are made with the Season 1 set bonus in mind. If you do not have the set bonus yet you can consider using :dr: [Distorted Reality](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=409044>) until you get the 2-set bonus for any builds that do not already use it.

# Leveling
For these builds be sure to check out the [guide](<https://www.icy-veins.com/wow/shadow-priest-leveling-guide>) directly for exact talent pathing suggestions as you level!

Archon is roughly 2-3% ahead of Voidweaver for this build.

## Single Target + :sc: [Shadow Crash](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=205385>)
These builds maximize single target damage while still having :sc: [Shadow Crash](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=205385>) and :sc: [Whispering Shadows](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=406777>).

Taking these builds you lose about **2%** single target damage on average.

# Dungeons
The below section is a high level overview of the top builds for dungeons. For more detail and other builds check out the :icyveins1: [IcyVeins](<https://www.icy-veins.com/wow/shadow-priest-pve-dps-mythic-plus-tips>) guide.

In addition to the builds below you can also consider running the Single Target + :sc: [Shadow Crash](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=205385>) build from the raid section above if you are trying to maximize Single Target damage.

:dp: [Mind's Eye](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=407470>) will give you more single-target priority target damage while in AoE, and :dr: [Distorted Reality](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=409044>) can get you more spread-target
damage. With Season 1's set bonus we prefer to use :dp: [Mind's Eye](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=407470>) and prio focus a single target.

By default the builds below assume you need Mental Fortitude (defensive) and Silence (utility). If you do not need both of these you can drop one for more throughput by adding back a damage point.
- Archon Push Key, Voidweaver Standard: :vt: [Maddening Touch](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=391228>)
- Archon Standard Key, Archon ST + Crash: :mind_dev: [Mind Devourer](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=373202>)

## Single Target Rankings
1. Archon Full Single Target: `0.0%`
2. Voidweaver Full Single Target: `-2%`
3. Archon Single Target + Shadow Crash: `-4%`
4. Voidweaver Standard Key Build: `-9%`
5. Archon Standard Key Build: `-10%`
6. Archon Push Key Build: `-13%`

## Archon - Standard Keys
Good for starting out, particularly if you want to get the build feeling of closer to the High Key build.

```

## Voidweaver - Standard Keys
Only a suggested build for lower keys where you might be pulling one pack at a time or packs are living for 20-30s max.

- Can swap out Depth of Shadows for Voidwraith for more single target.
- If you are in a dungeon with lots of magic damage (particularly Shadow) I would use Embrace the Shadow over Void Leech.
- If you are looking for more mob control you can experiment with using No Escape instead of Dark Energy. This might make the tanks job harder in some cases so be sure to coordinate with your group on what is best for that key.

## Archon - Push Keys
Once you start getting into the range where you are chain pulling packs together or packs are generally living 60s+ this is the build to start with if you can muster the single target loss.
