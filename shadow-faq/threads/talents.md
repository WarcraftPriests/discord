*Note: :ms: [Mind Spike](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=73510>) builds are roughly equal to
:mf: [Mind Flay](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=15407>) builds, play whichever you prefer.*
## Single Target + :sc: [Shadow Crash](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=205385>)
---------------------------ST + CRASH IMAGE HERE---------------------------
These builds maximize single target damage while still having :sc: [Shadow Crash](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=205385>) and :sc: [Whispering Shadows](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=406777>).

Taking these builds you lose about **1.5%** single target damage on average.

*Note: The :ms: [Mind Spike](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=73510>) build is roughly 2% ahead of the :mf: [Mind Flay](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=15407>) build on pure single target.
# 3 Target Council of Dreams
---------------------------3T IMAGE HERE---------------------------
This sim is designed specifically for Council of Dreams where you have 2 targets stacked and 1 off spread from the other two for a unique council boss. If you are able to keep the bosses stacked
more you might see more value from the Void Eruption build.

# Dungeons
The below section is a high level overview of the top builds for dungeons. For more detail and other builds check out the :icyveins1: [IcyVeins](<https://www.icy-veins.com/wow/shadow-priest-pve-dps-mythic-plus-tips>) guide.

These builds use flex points. The following can be swapped around and are within 1% damage of each other. These are roughly listed in order of strength.
- :mental_decay: [Mental Decay](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=375994>) (Single Target)
- :dark_evang: [Dark Evangelism](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=391095>)
- :mind_dev: [Mind Devourer](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=373202>) (Good with :dr: [Distorted Reality](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=409044>) builds)
- :phantasmal: [Phantasmal Pathogen](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=407469>)
- :vt: [Maddening Touch](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=391228>) (Good with :dp: [Mind's Eye](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=407470>) builds)
- :voidtouched: [Voidtouched](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=407430>) (Burst/:mf: [Mind Flay](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=15407>))

:dr: [Distorted Reality](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=409044>) and :dp: [Mind's Eye](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=407470>) are basically identical in terms of damage output in Mythic+. Certain builds will prefer Mind's Eye for more priority target damage inside AoE, while others will like Distorted Reality to make managing Devouring Plague easier. Pick whichever you prefer.

:ms: [Mind Spike](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=73510>) and :mf: [Mind Flay](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=15407>) builds are generally within margin of error. They are close enough to where you can play whichever you personally prefer.

While most situations you will see better results with :da: [Dark Ascension](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=391109>), as you get into higher push keys :void_eruption: [Void Eruption](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=228260>) still becomes competitive if not better as you are doing bigger pulls, less of them.
---------------------------BREAKDOWN IMAGE HERE---------------------------
## :nzoth1: [N'Zoth](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=373280>) + :cthun: [C'Thun](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=377349>) Build
General build that is the foundation m+ build.

I've listed several variations of this build, all of which are competitive. The :icyveins1: [IcyVeins](<https://www.icy-veins.com/wow/shadow-priest-pve-dps-mythic-plus-tips>) guide goes over these choices in depth.

Note: :da: [Dark Ascension](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=391109>) builds can flex between using :ms: [Mind Spike](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=73510>) or :mf: [Mind Flay](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=15407>) depending on your preference. :void_eruption: [Void Eruption](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=228260>) builds almost always play with Mind Flay.

### :da: [Dark Ascension](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=391109>) Version

[DA_nzoth_cthun_98186764744623_Spike_DR](<https://www.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/shadow/DAREEAVFEERUFEKFSKBQCBUNVRFUVVGQVFggRBE>)
```

```
- If you would like to use :dp: [Mind's Eye](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=407470>) the build is exactly the same with either choice.
- If you would like to use :mf: [Mind Flay](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=15407>) drop :ms: [Mind Spike](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=73510>) and Mind Melt for :voidtouched: [Voidtouched](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=407430>) and the last point in :dark_evang: [Dark Evangelism](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=391095>).

### :void_eruption: [Void Eruption](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=228260>) Version

[VF_nzoth_cthun_98186831574959_Flay_DR](<https://www.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/shadow/DAREEAVFEERUFEKFSKBQCBUNVRFUUVSgVFggRBU>)

- If you would like to use :dp: [Mind's Eye](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=407470>) you should consider swapping out :mastermind: [Mastermind](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=391151>) and use :screams: [Screams of the Void](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=375767>) instead.
- This build can drop :am: [Ancient Madness](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=341240>) for 1 point in :phantasmal: [Phantasmal Pathogen](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=407469>)

## :yshaarj: [Y'Shaarj](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=373310>) + :cthun: [C'Thun](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=377349>) Build
This build drops :nzoth1: [Idol of N'Zoth](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=373280>) and is a slight variation to the Raid Single Target build to add :sc: [Shadow Crash](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=205385>). This is equally competitive in Mythic+ dungeons, especially for Tyrannical weeks. As always you can still take :dp: [Mind's Eye](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=407470>) with these builds if you prefer.

*Note: This build is the same as the raid version.*

- **:dp: [Mind's Eye](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=407470>) version**: Swap out :mind_dev: [Mind Devourer](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=373202>) for :dark_evang: [Dark Evangelism](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=391095>) (ST) or :vt: [Maddening Touch](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=391228>) (AoE)
