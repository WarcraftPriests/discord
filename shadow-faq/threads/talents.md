*Note: Mind Spike has a slightly higher theoretical max (+0.6%) if you are able to fully turret.*
## Single Target + Shadow Crash
These builds maximize single target damage while still having Shadow Crash and Whispering Shadows.

# Dungeons
These builds still use flex points. The following can be swapped around and are within 1% damage of each other. These are roughly listed in order of strength.
- Mental Decay (Single Target)
- Dark Evangelism
- Mind Devourer (Good with Distorted Reality)
- Phantasmal Pathogen
- Maddening Touch
- Voidtouched (Burst/Mind Flay)

Distorted Reality is generally still outperforming Mind's Eye in the overall, although certain builds will prefer Mind's Eye for more single target or priority target damage. Pick whichever you prefer.
- 1.26% more m+ overall avg with Distorted Reality
- 0.62% more st with Distorted Reality when using Mind Spike, otherwise even.

Mind Spike and Mind Flay builds are generally within margin of error. Higher push keys slightly prefer Mind Flay generally speaking. They are close enough to where you can play whichever you personally prefer.

While most situations you will see better results with Dark Ascension, as you get into higher push keys Void Eruption still becomes competitive if not better as you are doing bigger pulls, less of them. At a high level when this happens the build is roughly the same as a Dark Ascension version.

## Y'Shaarj + N'Zoth + C'Thun
General build that is the foundation m+ build.

I've listed several variations of this build, all of which are competitive. Use the rough list to help understand which one makes sense for your key:
- Dark Ascension + Mind Flay: Standard option that will perform well in most keys of any level.
- Void Eruption + Mind Flay: Heavily trash focused build that thrives the more mobs you pull at once for a noticeable dip in single target. Particularly intended for high push keys.

Note: you can still play Mind Spike versions with Dark Ascension builds if you prefer.

### Dark Ascension

```

*Note: You can use either Distorted Reality or Mind's Eye with this build, everything else stays the same.*

### Void Eruption

## Y'Shaarj + C'Thun
This build drops Idol of N'Zoth and is a slight variation to the Raid Single Target build to add Shadow Crash. This is equally competitive in Mythic+ dungeons, especially for Tyranical weeks. As always you can still take Mind's eye with these builds if you prefer.
