## Gems
For the War Within you want to use [Elusive Blasphemite](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=213746>) as your epic gem. To scale this gem we want to use one of every color
gem _except_ for Amber. Use the below list as a rough order to socket into your gear.
1. [Culminating Blasphemite](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=213743>)
2. [Masterful Emerald](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=213482>)
3. [Quick Onyx](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=213494>)
4. [Masterful Ruby](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=213458>)
5. [Masterful Sapphire](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=213473>)
6. [Masterful Emerald](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=213482>) on remaining 4 sockets

For the final 4 sockets, you should pick either [Masterful Emerald](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=213482>) if you are lacking on Haste, or [Quick Onyx](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=213494>) if you have a decent amount. Usually, early on in the gearing process, you will lean towards Haste, and towards the end, you will stack more Mastery. On single target, you will typically notice Mastery being more valuable and on AoE Haste being more valuable.

Technically Culminating Blasphemite is more damage but it is so minor (0.2% DPS) that it is not worth the significant loss in movement speed compared to the Elusive Gem. Using these gems gives you an incentive to have one of each colored gem socketed.

Note that gems this expansion are considerably less DPS than they have been in previous expansions. This will mean simming massive gem re-combinations on Raidbots will be very difficult to get accurate information out of without absolutely cranking iterations. I strongly suggest just following this advice and not putting too much weight in gem recraft sims.
