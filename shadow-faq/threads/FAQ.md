## How do I use :spymasters: Spymaster's Web?
The best way to use :spymasters: [Spymaster's Web](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=220202>) as a Shadow Priest is to save for execute with full cds and full stacks of the trinket. Can use otherwise at full stacks with full cds if you still get the execute cast. Depending on fight duration you might choose to use at lower stacks earlier on in the fight if you know the execute cast is fixed (i.e. using at 2m/6m for a 7 minute fight).

In Mythic+ you should optimize your use for when the group most needs the damage. Rough advice until you get comfortable with when that is in keys is with full stacks for bosses or big trash pulls with Bloodlust.

This is about 3% better overall damage than just sending it with each cast of Power Infusion.

## How do I play around Unfurling Darkness?
The best way to use Unfurling Darkness is by prioritizing it above Mind Blast when off cooldown as long as Dark Ascension is not active or you have nothing else besides base fillers of Mind Spike or Mind Flay available. You will not end up strictly speaking using it on cooldown but will be used throughout the rotation. Once you proc it you will generally cast Vampiric Touch again to consume it right after.

To check if it is available to press you simply need to see if you have the debuff active or not.

You can use [this WeakAura](<https://wago.io/VZNUnVvO0>) to help track Vampiric Touch and Unfurling Darkness. For more rotational tips check out the [guide](<https://www.icy-veins.com/wow/shadow-priest-pve-dps-rotation-cooldowns-abilities>).

## Is Fateweaver and the Fateweaved weapon BiS?
Fate Weaver is a rare off-hand that can drop from Open World content, including Delves. This creates Fateweaved Needle which is a proc-effect 1-handed weapon. If you get lucky and get this to drop after using a Map or inside your Vault at Hero track this can be a powerful weapon while gearing up. This generally is better than other item level weapons at equal item level but will evenetually be replaced by Myth track weapons. More info can be found in the [Wowhead Post](<https://www.wowhead.com/news/how-to-obtain-fateweaved-weapons-likely-best-in-slot-caster-weapons-for-tww-346717>).

## How do I change the stats on Changeling?
Shadow Priest prefers to run Unbound Changeling with Mastery (Single Target) or Haste (AoE). The All proc is generally not better for us. For help simming this trinket use [this guide](<https://gist.github.com/seanpeters86/5d78a096c710a502fa36a7d9b869b23d>).
