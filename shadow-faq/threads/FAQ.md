## When should I upgrade my current tier?
This is extremely personal to your own characters gear and what you might be upgrading to, and you should sim yourself. Use the below for rough guidelines of upgrades when compared against a Season 2 full BiS character.

While gearing early you can prioritize running _new_ Chest/Hands and run 2pc from Season 2 alongside 2pc from Season 3. Chest/Hands are not the best slots for either season but this should give you the biggest item level increase going to the new tier.
- Rough priority when running 2+2: Hands > Chest > Shoulders > Legs > Head (since you still have it socketed)
- You should plan to run 2pc+2pc ASAP, even base normal 463 item level should be good enough to swap to

If you are lucky enough to get enough tier for Season 3 4pc you will likely want to use it. The item level gain by itself should be enough to use it right away.
- You should plan to *DROP* the following slot in the following order going from ideal to less ideal as you first gear up: Head > Shoulders > Chest > Hands > Legs. The socket you have on your helm from Season 2 is carrying its weight here, once you get a helm socketed that will change your ideal setup.
- BiS 4pc with full Season 3 items: Head/Shoulders/Legs + Gloves > Chest

### Rough Gains on Single Target:
The following shows the gain when going from BiS Season 2 to the following upgrade sets. This is using Undulating Sporecloak and Allied Wristguards of Time Dilation. These increases are factoring in the item level gain but leaving the rest of the gear as is. Again be sure to sim your own character to get a more accurate picture.
- 463 2pc: 5.1%
- 463 4pc: 8.8%
