# FAQs

**Is Mind Flay Gone?**
- When talenting into Mind Spike it replaces Mind Flay.

**I dont want to play Mind Spike, how bad is it?**
- 1-3% DPS, not a massive deal.

**Onyx Anulet?**
- not worth

**Should I stop using Lariat?**
- Lariat is still good if you have full sockets. As soon as you start to lose them it might make sense to drop this for BSL/Shadowflame/etc. Be sure to sim as what you replace it with can change the right thing to do.

**How do you use Devouring Plague in AoE?**
- With Mind's Eye you just keep it rolling on a single priority target.
- With Distorted Reality you can spread this DoT around as targets will live for most of the duration.

**Which Phial should I use?**
- Vers Phial is good if you want a mix of offensive and defensive power. If you can maintain 70%+ uptime on Corrupting Rage Phial that will net you better dps.
