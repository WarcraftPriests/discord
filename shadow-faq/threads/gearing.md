## Raid
- [Astral Antenna](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=242395>)
- [Araz's Ritual Forge](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=242402>)
- [Diamantine Voidcore](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=242392>)

# Crafted Gear (Embellishments)
## Raiding Path
This section is focused on the best crafts in a Raiding environment. These rankings tend to prefer more consistent effects that specialize in single-target damage.

1. Craft :crafted_staff: [Vagabond's Bounding Baton](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=222568>) with :ascension: [Darkmoon Sigil: Ascension](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=226024>). This weapon will not be the Best-in-Slot but it will be the biggest gain you can get early on in the Season. If you already have a strong Myth track 1-handed weapon, you can skip this step and instead craft it on :crafted_oh: [Vagabond's Torch](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=222566>).
2. Craft an item with :writhing: [Writhing Armor Banding](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=219506>). This effectively doubles :ascension: [Darkmoon Sigil: Ascension](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=226024>) without having to craft it on another weapon. You should craft this in your worst slot for the biggest upgrade, long term, this is ideally on Wrists, Feet, or Waist slot.
3. Craft :crafted_oh: [Vagabond's Torch](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=222566>) with :ascension: [Darkmoon Sigil: Ascension](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=226024>) to replace your :crafted_staff: [Vagabond's Bounding Baton](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=222568>). This should only be done once you get a good Myth track 1-handed weapon.
4. After you have your Embellished items, you should prioritize crafting items to gain the most item level.

Note: You can also choose to use :duskthread: [Duskthread Lining](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=222873>) or :dawnthread: [Dawnthread Lining](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=222870>) if you do not want to double down with :writhing: [Writhing Armor Banding](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=219506>). These options usually are less damage, but depending on the situation, they might be better for you. Duskthread is usually preferred for the small extra defensive benefit but Dawnthread will typically sim a bit more.

## Mythic+ Path
This section is focused on the best crafts in a Mythic+ environment. These rankings are aimed at maximizing overall damage inside of Mythic+.

1. Craft :crafted_staff: [Vagabond's Bounding Baton](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=222568>) with :ascension: [Darkmoon Sigil: Ascension](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=226024>). This weapon will not be the Best-in-Slot but it will be the biggest gain you can get early on in the Season. If you already have a strong Myth track 1-handed weapon, you can skip this step.
2. Craft an item with :duskthread: [Duskthread Lining](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=222873>) or :dawnthread: [Dawnthread Lining](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=222870>). Dawnthread is usually slightly more damage but Duskthread also provides a small defensive benefit which is why it is preferred. You should craft this in your worst slot for the biggest upgrade, long term, this is ideally on Wrists, Feet, or Waist slot.
3. Pick one of the options below:
  - OPTION: Craft :crafted_oh: [Vagabond's Torch](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=222566>) with :ascension: [Darkmoon Sigil: Ascension](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=226024>) to replace your :crafted_staff: [Vagabond's Bounding Baton](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=222568>). This should only be done once you get a good Myth track 1-handed weapon.
  - OPTION: If you find yourself dropping combat too often to get good value out of :ascension: [Darkmoon Sigil: Ascension](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=226024>) you can instead craft another item with :duskthread: [Duskthread Lining](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=222873>) or :dawnthread: [Dawnthread Lining](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=222870>).
4. After you have your Embellished items, you should prioritize crafting items to gain the most item level.

For Mythic+ you will notice :ascension: [Darkmoon Sigil: Ascension](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=226024>) generally performing worse than other options if you have lots of downtime between pulls. While we suggest crafting this early to get our weapon item level, this is something you can consider phasing out of your gear entirely, depending on your typical pulls.

# Secondary Stats
Your general stat priority is as follows:
## Single Target
```
Haste >= Mastery > Critical Strike > Versatility
```
### AoE/Mythic+
```
Haste > Mastery > Critical Strike >= Versatility
```

Note that the following are simply examples. You should sim your character for individual gear swaps, these are just a range to look for.
