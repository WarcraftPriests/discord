# Trinkets
As a Shadow Priest you always want to use :spymasters: [Spymaster's Web](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=220202>). This trinket is a lock in choice for all content and is typically paired with a passive trinket.

**Note**: For [Unbound Changeling](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=178708>) we generally
prefer setting ths to Mastery (Single Target) or Haste (Mythic+).
## Raid
:spymasters: [Spymaster's Web](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=220202>) should be used with any of:
- :sacbrood: [Ara-Kara Sacbrood](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=219314>)
- :gale_of_shadows: [Gale of Shadows](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=133304>)
- :changeling: [Unbound Changeling](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=178708>)
- :crystal~2: [Empowering Crystal of Anubikkaj](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=219312>)
- :ovinax: [Ovi'nax's Mercurial Egg](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=220305>) (Voidweaver only - ideal stacks 20 primary/10 secondary)
## Dungeons
:spymasters: [Spymaster's Web](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=220202>) should be used with any of:
- :sacbrood: [Ara-Kara Sacbrood](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=219314>)
- :gale_of_shadows: [Gale of Shadows](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=133304>)
- :changeling: [Unbound Changeling](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=178708>)
- :crystal~2: [Empowering Crystal of Anubikkaj](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=219312>)
- :spellforge: [Aberrant Spellforge](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=212451>) (If you can keep stacks up throughout the dungeon)
## Notes
In addition to the top trinkets for Raid and Mythic+ there are also several strong trinkets that drop from Delves that can drop up to Hero track. These will not be BiS because they cannot drop at Myth track but are typically stronger than other trinkets at equal item level and are good for gearing in the early-mid game of Season 1.
- :shadow_knife: [Shadow-Binding Ritual Knife](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=215178>)
- :quickwick: [Quickwick Candlestick](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=225649>)
- :candle~1: [Candle Confidant](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=225648>) (ST Only)

# Crafted Gear (Embellishments)
## Raiding Path
This section is focused on the best crafts in a Raiding environment. These rankings tend to prefer more consistent effects that specialize in single-target damage.

1. Craft :crafted_staff: [Vagabond's Bounding Baton](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=222568>) with :ascension: [Darkmoon Sigil: Ascension](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=226024>). This weapon will not be the Best-in-Slot but it will be the biggest gain you can get early on in the Season. If you already have a strong Hero track or Myth track 1-handed weapon, you can skip this step and instead craft it on :crafted_oh: [Vagabond's Torch](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=222566>).
2. Craft an item with :writhing: [Writhing Armor Banding](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=219506>). This effectively doubles :ascension: [Darkmoon Sigil: Ascension](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=226024>) without having to craft it on another weapon. You should craft this in your worst slot for the biggest upgrade, long term, this is ideally on Wrists, Feet, or Waist slot.
3. Craft :crafted_oh: [Vagabond's Torch](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=222566>) with :ascension: [Darkmoon Sigil: Ascension](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=226024>) to replace your :crafted_staff: [Vagabond's Bounding Baton](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=222568>). This should only be done once you get a good Myth track 1-handed weapon.
4. After you have your Embellished items, you should prioritize crafting items to gain the most item level.

Note: You can also choose to use :duskthread: [Duskthread Lining](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=222873>) or :dawnthread: [Dawnthread Lining](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=222870>) if you do not want to double down with :writhing: [Writhing Armor Banding](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=219506>). These options usually are less damage, but depending on the situation, they might be better for you. Duskthread is usually preferred for the small extra defensive benefit but Dawnthread will typically sim a bit more.

## Mythic+ Path
This section is focused on the best crafts in a Mythic+ environment. These rankings are aimed at maximizing overall damage inside of Mythic+.

1. Craft :crafted_staff: [Vagabond's Bounding Baton](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=222568>) with :ascension: [Darkmoon Sigil: Ascension](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=226024>). This weapon will not be the Best-in-Slot but it will be the biggest gain you can get early on in the Season. If you already have a strong Hero track or Myth track 1-handed weapon, you can skip this step.
2. Craft an item with :duskthread: [Duskthread Lining](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=222873>) or :dawnthread: [Dawnthread Lining](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=222870>). Dawnthread is usually slightly more damage but Duskthread also provides a small defensive benefit which is why it is preferred. You should craft this in your worst slot for the biggest upgrade, long term, this is ideally on Wrists, Feet, or Waist slot.
3. Pick one of the options below:
  - OPTION: Craft :crafted_oh: [Vagabond's Torch](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=222566>) with :ascension: [Darkmoon Sigil: Ascension](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=226024>) to replace your :crafted_staff: [Vagabond's Bounding Baton](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=222568>). This should only be done once you get a good Myth track 1-handed weapon.
  - OPTION: If you find yourself dropping combat too often to get good value out of :ascension: [Darkmoon Sigil: Ascension](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=226024>) you can instead craft another item with :duskthread: [Duskthread Lining](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=222873>) or :dawnthread: [Dawnthread Lining](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=222870>).
4. After you have your Embellished items, you should prioritize crafting items to gain the most item level.

For Mythic+ you will notice :ascension: [Darkmoon Sigil: Ascension](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=226024>) generally performing worse than other options if you have lots of downtime between pulls. While we suggest crafting this early to get our weapon item level, this is something you can consider phasing out of your gear entirely, depending on your typical pulls.

## Notes on Crafting
You might see some people choose to use :bob: [Binding of Binding](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=215133>). This item can perform similarly to :ascension: [Darkmoon Sigil: Ascension](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=226024>) but requires quite a lot of setup to get an increase out of since using it just by yourself does not provide any personal DPS benefit.
