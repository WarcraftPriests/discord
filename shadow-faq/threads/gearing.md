# Crafted Gear (Embellishments)
All embellishes are in SimC. The below are roughly ranked in order of power.

In both section you will notice [Allied Wristguards of Time Dilation](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=193530>) relatively high up. On their own they provide ~`0.8%` DPS upgrade to yourself. By itself this is roughly equivalent to [Blue Silken Lining](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=193944>) with ~20-30% uptime. This by itself is not massive, but if you take into account the Raid DPS gained it significantly outperforms BSL more consistently. In addition, if you get more groups members to use this you will get more damage as well! It gives 482 Versatility at 486 and the proc rate is hasted, and you can get multiple buffs at once if others are using it. I would strongly consider using this for prog content.

# Secondary Stats
Generally seeing a trend where the actor is slightly favoring Mastery over Haste.
```
Mastery >= Haste > Critical Strike > Versatility
```

For a more well-rounded setup I would suggest keeping Haste and Mastery more equal, while on single target you can lean more towards Mastery.

Stat Distribution Example for Single Target:
- Mastery: 6000
- Haste: 6000
- Critical Strike: 3000
- Versatility: 1000
