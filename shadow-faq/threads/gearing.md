# Crafted Gear (Embellishments)
All embellishes are in SimC. The below are roughly ranked in order of power.

In both section you will notice Allied Wristguards of Time Dialation relatively high up. On their own they provide `0.5%` DPS upgrade to yourself. By itself this is roughly equivilant to Blue Silken Lining with ~20-30% uptime. This by itself is not massive, but if you take into account the Raid DPS gained it significantly outperforms BSL more consistently. In addition, if you get more groups members to use this you will get more damage as well! It gives 535 Versatility at 483 and the proc rate is hasted, and you can get multiple buffs at once if others are using it. I would strongly consider using this for prog content.

## Others
There are also several cantrip weapons that are a DPS increase as well to consider:
1. Vakash the Shadowed Infernal

# Tier Set (T31) Value
- 2 set: 8.96%
- 2+4 set: 12.04%

# Secondary Stats
Generally seeing a trend where the actor is slightly favoring Mastery over Haste.
```
Mastery >= Haste > Critical Strike > Versatility
```

For a more well-rounded setup I would suggest keeping Haste and Mastery more equal, while on single target you can lean more towards Mastery.

Stat Distribution Example for Single Target:
- Mastery: 6000
- Haste: 6000
- Critical Strike: 3000
- Versatility: 1000

I would suggest keeping Haste and Mastery more equal for a more well rounded setup.
