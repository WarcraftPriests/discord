2. [Neltharion's Call to Suffering](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=204211>)

5. [Spoils of Neltharus](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=193773>)
6. [Ashes of the Embersoul](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=207167>)

*Note:* Umbrelskul's can also be pretty great in Mythic+ depending on procs.

## Ominous Chromatic Essence
You can generally use _any_ of the buffs for this trinket, especially if it means your group gets all of them active. Typically Shadow Priests will gravitate towards Emerald or Ruby to make sure the effect is not subject to stat DR's but you might favor Bronze or even Azure at lower gear levels.

# Crafted Gear (Embellishments)
All embellishes are in SimC. The below are roughly ranked in order of power.

Note that are roughly equivalent to 60-70% BSL uptime, these are basically a progression only item. In Season 4 you might not run into this level of difficulty in which case I would skip it.

## Raid
1. :wristguards: [Allied Wristguards of Time Dilation](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=193530>) (Progression ONLY)
2. :bsl: [Blue Silken Lining](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=193944>) (Can run two of these)
## Dungeons
1. :hood: [Hood of Surging Time](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=193521>) (Most Key Levels)
2. :bsl: [Blue Silken Lining](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=193944>) (Max Damage for High Keys) (Can run two of these)
3. :wristguards: [Allied Wristguards of Time Dilation](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=193530>) (if not using Engineering Battle-Rez Wrists)

## Others
If you are looking for more defensive options you can consider using :sporecloak: [Undulating Sporecloak](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=205025>) and/or the [Choker of Shielding](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=193002>). Sporecloak gives about `0.5%` DPS. Using either of these options would cost you on average 2-3% DPS each compared to a throughput embellishment.

# Special-Effects

## Weapons
This season you want to prioritize getting :vakash: [Vakash, the Shadowed Infernal](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=207788>) and a strong off-hand. :dreambinder: [Dreambinder, Loom of the Great Cycle](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=208616>) can be good early on, but generally speaking is worse offensively and can cause issues with melee-DPS in Mythic+ environments. Vakash also contributes to proccing the special-effect fire items.

## Rings & Neck
This season you should aim to either purchase or acquire the two special-effect rings from Vault of the Incarnates. Both of these can be procced effectively when using Vakash and the helm enchant, Incandescent Essence. You can also use the neck from Amirdrassil for more defensive value.

- [Seal of Diurna's Chosen](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=195480>)
- [Seal of Filial Duty](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=195526>)
- [Ouroboreal Necklet](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=210214>)

# What to spend Bullions on?
Below is a rough list, and not set in stone for every player. Depending on other drops you get you might adjust this list.

1. :vakash: [Vakash, the Shadowed Infernal](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=207788>)
2. [Seal of Diurna's Chosen](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=195480>)
3. [Neltharion's Call to Suffering](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=204211>)
4. [Whispering Incarnate Icon](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=194301>) (At least a Tank or Healer)
5. [Voice of the Silent Star](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=204465>)
6. [Ominous Chromatic Essence](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=203729>)
7. [Seal of Filial Duty](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=195526>)

Note that as the season goes on you can eventually buy everything you would need. You can acquire one Bullion per week and need 2 to purchase an item.

# Tier Set (S4) Value

## Single Target
- 2 set: 4.07%
- 2+4 set: 10.89%
## Dungeon Overall
- 2 set: 2.24%
- 2+4 set: 6.90%

# Secondary Stats
Your general stat priority is as follows:

:void_eruption: [Void Eruption](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=228260>):
```
Haste > Mastery > Critical Strike > Versatility
```

:da: [Dark Ascension](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=391109>):
```
Mastery >= Haste > Critical Strike >= Versatility
```

Note that the following are simply examples. You should sim your character for individual gear swaps, these are just a range to look for.

Stat Distribution Example for :void_eruption: [Void Eruption](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=228260>):
- Mastery: 5500
- Haste: 7000
- Critical Strike: 3500
- Versatility: 2000

Stat Distribution Example for :da: [Dark Ascension](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=391109>):
- Mastery: 5500
- Haste: 5500
- Critical Strike: 3500
- Versatility: 3500

If you are optimizing for high push-key Mythic+ environments you should strongly consider using more Versatility than usual. As long as you keep about 5000 Haste and Mastery you can continue to stack Versatility for a relatively small damage loss for a massive gain in survivability.
