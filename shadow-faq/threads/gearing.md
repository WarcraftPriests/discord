## Timewalking Trinkets
Currently there are several timewalking trinkets from Timewalking Raids that are performing well. When these raids show up I would consider checking out the value of these trinkets.

# Crafted Gear (Embellishments)
Embellishments in Season 1 are extremely underwhelming in value. They are also changing balancing and scaling of these relatively often still so until things are more concrete you should not plan on crafting anything until Mythic opening week at the earliest while we let Blizzard settle down and balancing is more stable.

Here is what things look like currently.

1. Craft [Binding of Binding](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=215133>) if you can pair with an ally to give each other the benefit. This does not give you any personal DPS without someone else pairing with you. If you are not in a situation where you are able to trade with someone, you should consider using something else.
2. Craft an item with [Duskthread Lining](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=222873>). Ideally, in the Wrists, Feet, or Waist slot, depending on which is worse.
3. Craft your second item with [Duskthread Lining](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=222873>). Ideally, in the Wrists, Feet, or Waist slot, depending on which is worse. This should be used anytime that you cannot trade [Binding of Binding](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=215133>) with someone.
4. After you have your Embellished items, you should prioritize crafting items to gain the most item level.

[Duskthread Lining](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=222873>) and [Dawnthread Lining](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=222870>) are so close in value we suggest going with [Duskthread Lining](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=222873>) for the small extra defensive benefit.

If you are looking for the biggest upgrade early on you can consider crafting [Everforged Dagger](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=222439>) with [Blessed Weapon Grip](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=219497>). You will eventually replace this with a Myth track weapon but might be a nice upgrade early depending on your current weapon. You will be hard pressed to find a good off-hand as there is only one great one this season with [Pail of Preserved Obscurity](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=221172>).

# Tier Set (S1) Value

## Single Target
- 2 set: 2.1%
- 2+4 set: 5.4%
## Dungeon Overall
- 2 set: 1.7%
- 2+4 set: 4.8%

# Secondary Stats
Your general stat priority is as follows:

Single Target:
```
Mastery > Haste > Critical Strike > Versatility
```

AoE/Mythic+:
```
Haste > Mastery > Critical Strike >= Versatility
```

Note that the following are simply examples. You should sim your character for individual gear swaps, these are just a range to look for.

Stat Goals:
1. Gear up your character, prioritizing getting as much Haste and Mastery as possible. Acquiring Intellect is your top priority.
2. Haste, to around ～15-20%
3. Mastery, to around ～15-18%
4. Critical Strike, to around ～10-15%
5. Dump the rest of stats into Mastery on Single Target or Haste on AoE
