# Cyrce's Circlet
This is the new ring from the [Siren Isle](<https://www.wowhead.com/guide/the-war-within/patch-11-0-7-cyrces-circlet-customizable-ring>). You get the ring at 639 and is upgraded to level 658. You collect different types of gems to socket into the ring (Thunder, Sea, and Wind). This ring is Best-In-Slot all throughout Season 2 assuming at least a few people are also using **Legendary Skippers Citrine**. If you are in a group where no one else is using that gem you can instead use **Windsinger's Runed Citrine**. Windsinger's will typically sim evenly with a 678 Myth track equivalent ring.

As a Shadow Priest we always use the following gems in all PvE content:
- :thunder_cloud_rain: Thunder: **Stormbringer's Runed Citrine**
- :ocean: Sea: **Fathomdweller's Runed Citrine**
- :LegacyWind: Wind: **Legendary Skippers Citrine**
# Trinkets
This section lists the top trinkets to consider for Raiding and Mythic+. Oftentimes these are extremely close together and you can easily do well with any combination.
## Raid
- [Eye of Kezan](<https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=230198>) (Great for long prog fights)
- [Mug's Moxie Jug](<https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=230192>)
- [Signet of the Priory](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=219308>) (Better with more people using it)
## Dungeons
- [Eye of Kezan](<https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=230198>) (If you can keep stacks up)
- [Mug's Moxie Jug](<https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=230192>)
- [Signet of the Priory](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=219308>) (Better with more people using it)
- [House of Cards](<https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=230027>)
- [Soulletting Ruby](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=178809>) (Snipe low health targets)
## Notes
In addition to the top trinkets for Raid and Mythic+ there are also several strong trinkets that drop from Delves that can drop up to Hero track. These will not be BiS because they cannot drop at Myth track but are typically stronger than other trinkets at equal item level and are good for gearing in the early-mid game of Season 2.
- :shadow_knife: [Shadow-Binding Ritual Knife](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=215178>)
- :quickwick: [Quickwick Candlestick](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=225649>)
- [Suspicious Energy Drink](<https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=235363>)
- [Funhouse Lens](<https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=234217>)
- [Amorphous Relic](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=446835>)

[Synergistic Brewterializer](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=219299>) is looking to be very competitive in early testing but we still need to finish implementing this into SimC. Until this is finished it is oversimming.

# Crafted Gear (Embellishments)
## Raiding Path
This section is focused on the best crafts in a Raiding environment. These rankings tend to prefer more consistent effects that specialize in single-target damage.

1. Craft :crafted_staff: [Vagabond's Bounding Baton](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=222568>) with :ascension: [Darkmoon Sigil: Ascension](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=226024>). This weapon will not be the Best-in-Slot but it will be the biggest gain you can get early on in the Season. If you already have a strong Hero track or Myth track 1-handed weapon, you can skip this step and instead craft it on :crafted_oh: [Vagabond's Torch](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=222566>).
2. Craft an item with :writhing: [Writhing Armor Banding](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=219506>). This effectively doubles :ascension: [Darkmoon Sigil: Ascension](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=226024>) without having to craft it on another weapon. You should craft this in your worst slot for the biggest upgrade, long term, this is ideally on Wrists, Feet, or Waist slot.
3. Craft :crafted_oh: [Vagabond's Torch](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=222566>) with :ascension: [Darkmoon Sigil: Ascension](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=226024>) to replace your :crafted_staff: [Vagabond's Bounding Baton](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=222568>). This should only be done once you get a good Myth track 1-handed weapon.
4. After you have your Embellished items, you should prioritize crafting items to gain the most item level.

Note: You can also choose to use :duskthread: [Duskthread Lining](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=222873>) or :dawnthread: [Dawnthread Lining](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=222870>) if you do not want to double down with :writhing: [Writhing Armor Banding](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=219506>). These options usually are less damage, but depending on the situation, they might be better for you. Duskthread is usually preferred for the small extra defensive benefit but Dawnthread will typically sim a bit more.

## Mythic+ Path
This section is focused on the best crafts in a Mythic+ environment. These rankings are aimed at maximizing overall damage inside of Mythic+.

1. Craft :crafted_staff: [Vagabond's Bounding Baton](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=222568>) with :ascension: [Darkmoon Sigil: Ascension](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=226024>). This weapon will not be the Best-in-Slot but it will be the biggest gain you can get early on in the Season. If you already have a strong Hero track or Myth track 1-handed weapon, you can skip this step.
2. Craft an item with :duskthread: [Duskthread Lining](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=222873>) or :dawnthread: [Dawnthread Lining](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=222870>). Dawnthread is usually slightly more damage but Duskthread also provides a small defensive benefit which is why it is preferred. You should craft this in your worst slot for the biggest upgrade, long term, this is ideally on Wrists, Feet, or Waist slot.
3. Pick one of the options below:
  - OPTION: Craft :crafted_oh: [Vagabond's Torch](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=222566>) with :ascension: [Darkmoon Sigil: Ascension](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=226024>) to replace your :crafted_staff: [Vagabond's Bounding Baton](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=222568>). This should only be done once you get a good Myth track 1-handed weapon.
  - OPTION: If you find yourself dropping combat too often to get good value out of :ascension: [Darkmoon Sigil: Ascension](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=226024>) you can instead craft another item with :duskthread: [Duskthread Lining](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=222873>) or :dawnthread: [Dawnthread Lining](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=222870>).
4. After you have your Embellished items, you should prioritize crafting items to gain the most item level.

For Mythic+ you will notice :ascension: [Darkmoon Sigil: Ascension](<https://www.wowhead.com/item=226024>) generally performing worse than other options if you have lots of downtime between pulls. While we suggest crafting this early to get our weapon item level, this is something you can consider phasing out of your gear entirely, depending on your typical pulls.

## Notes on Crafting
Eventually we will want to use [Big Earner's Bludgeon](<https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=228901>) in all forms of content paired with the crafted off-hand. If you get this early enough at Hero track you could consider skipping crafting the 2-handed weapon.

# Secondary Stats
Your general stat priority is as follows:

```

AoE/Mythic+:
```
Haste >= Mastery > Critical Strike >= Versatility
```

Note that the following are simply examples. You should sim your character for individual gear swaps, these are just a range to look for.
